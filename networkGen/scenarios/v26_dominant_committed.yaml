# V26 Dominant — Committed True Believers
#
# Identical to v26_dominant except the three high-ideology v27 nodes are
# permanent true believers: ideology=1.0, switching_threshold=1.0.
# The model's max price divergence is ~20%, so a 100% threshold means
# these nodes can NEVER be triggered to switch forks.
#
# High-ideology v27 true believers (3/12 = 25% of v27 partition):
#   Foundry USA pool   (ideology=1.0, max_loss_pct=10.0 in pool scenario)
#   v27 economic node  (ideology=1.0, switching_threshold=1.0)
#   v27 user node      (ideology=1.0, switching_threshold=1.0)
#
# OCEAN and Braiins Pool retain moderate ideology and can still defect.
# v27 holds at least 26.89% hashrate (Foundry USA) for the entire run.
