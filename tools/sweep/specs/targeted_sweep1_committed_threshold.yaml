description: >
  Map the 2D decision boundary between economic_split and pool_committed_split
  at a fixed low hashrate (hash=0.25, clearly v26-dominant). Any v27 win here
  requires the economic cascade mechanism to succeed, making this a clean probe
  of the cascade gatekeeper threshold identified in the exploratory sweep.

  From the exploratory sweep (n=50, seed=42):
    - committed_split < ~0.43 blocked cascade even with 88-93% v27 economic majority
    - committed_split > ~0.53 enabled cascade with as little as 58% v27 economic
  This sweep maps that boundary at 5 economic levels and 9 committed_split steps.

# All parameters NOT listed under 'grid' must appear here.
# Values are set to medians from the exploratory sweep (realistic_sweep3, seed=42).

# The two axes being mapped.
# economic_split: spans the low-econ zone (0.35, 0.50) through the threshold
#                 and into high v27 economic majority (0.60, 0.70, 0.82).
# pool_committed_split: 9 steps with dense sampling around the estimated
#                       0.43-0.53 transition zone from the exploratory sweep.
